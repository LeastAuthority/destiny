# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/montserrat/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:

    - family: Lato
      fonts:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/privacy.png
    - assets/images/logo.png
    - assets/images/send.png
    - assets/images/receive.png
    - assets/images/device-device.png
    - assets/images/intro-logo.png
    - assets/images/file-sent-white.png
    - assets/images/SETTINGS-WHITE.png
    - assets/images/icons/Paste-white.png
    - assets/images/icons/DEVICEWHITE.png
    - assets/images/icons/SETTINGS-WHITE-with-circle.png
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:


  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
