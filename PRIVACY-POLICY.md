## What data we collect

### When downloading the application

We do not collect information about people who download the software via GitHub. On Github, we only have access to traffic data for the repository such as number of visitors and number of views of the repository. 

However, third parties such as the Google Play store and the hosting provider, OVH Cloud, can collect some information including individual users’ IP address. We have no control of that and do not actively try to access such information. 

Google provides us with the following information:
Android Version: Android OS version reported from the user's device
Device: User's device Marketing Name and Device Name (for example, Google Nexus 7/Flo)
Country: User's country
Language: User's Android OS language setting
Carrier: User's wireless carrier (when applicable)
App Version

Our hosting provider, OVH Cloud, collects the following information: 
IP address
Time and date of request

In addition, our mailbox server and transit relay are collecting the following basic statistics:
Outcome of a transfer (did the parties connect)
Time of a transfer 

The legal basis for the processing of this data is our legitimate interest to ensure the functionality, the integrity and security of the application (Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR). 

### When using the services
We do not collect contact information (name, email address, phone number) about people who send/receive files. 

We do not store and cannot open files that are sent using Destiny. 

When you send/receive a file directly, the two parties involved can learn each others’ IP address.

Files sent using Destiny are end-to-end encrypted. 

Destiny is built on [Magic Wormhole](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html), which uses the SPAKE2 cryptographic algorithm to establish a strong high-entropy shared key with a short low-entropy password (the code). All data is encrypted (with nacl/libsodium “secretbox”) using this key. 

For more details see our [FAQ](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/destiny/blob/main/FAQ.md).

### When contacting us
When you email us, we will inevitably collect the content of your email, your email address, the sender name, and anything else included in the email header.

Emails are currently stored with our email provider Google. 

We keep emails received for as long as necessary to handle the issue.  Six months after an issue has been handled or solved, we erase the email.

Data processing for the purpose of contacting us is based on your voluntarily given consent (Art. 6 para. 1 (a) GDPR), or  - in case of general issues with our system - based on our legitime interest in the function of our service (Art. 6 para. 1 (f) GDPR).

We do not share any of your personal data with anyone outside of Least Authority or, by default, the sub-processors mentioned above.
